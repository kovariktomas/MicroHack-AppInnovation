# Common Errors & Resolutions

Documenting issues encountered while implementing the data generator (Azure OpenAI Responses API + Images) and their fixes.

## 1. Unsupported parameter: `response_format` / `modalities`
**Symptom:** Exceptions when calling `client.responses.create` with `response_format` or `modalities=["text","image"]`.

**Cause:** The installed OpenAI Python SDK (Azure variant) version doesn't support those legacy / speculative parameters for the Responses API in this context.

**Resolution:** Use `client.responses.parse` with `text_format="json_schema"` and a Pydantic model to obtain structured outputs (categories + items). Removed unsupported args.

## 2. Pydantic `@validator` Deprecation Warnings
**Symptom:** Warnings about `@validator` being deprecated (Pydantic v2).

**Cause:** Pydantic v2 replaced classic validators with `@field_validator`.

**Resolution:** Migrated all validators to `@field_validator(..., mode="before"|"after")` as appropriate.

## 3. Image generation via Responses API returning HTTP 400
**Symptom:** Consistent 400 Bad Request when attempting image generation through `responses.create` (both with `modalities` and with tool definitions for image generation).

**Cause:** The SDK / deployment combination did not accept the attempted usage pattern for inline image generation (likely feature mismatch or unsupported tool contract in current API version).

**Resolution:** Switched to dedicated `client.images.generate(...)` call using the image deployment. Added simple retry with exponential backoff. This produced images reliably.

## 4. Partial image set (198/200) produced
**Symptom:** After generation, two catalog entries had no corresponding PNG files.

**Possible Causes:** Transient API errors beyond retry attempts or silent failures not surfaced (insufficient logging around failures at time of run).

**Resolution:** Implemented `prune_missing_images.py` to:
- Detect mismatch between `catalog.json` and `images/` directory
- Optionally prune missing entries (creates `catalog.json.bak` once)

## 5. Difficulty scripting PowerShell inline heredoc for Python
**Symptom:** Parser errors (`Missing file specification after redirection operator`) when trying to embed Python with `<<` in PowerShell.

**Cause:** Bash-style heredoc syntax used in PowerShell environment.

**Resolution:** Instead of heredoc, created a temporary file via `$temp = New-TemporaryFile` and wrote Python code with `Set-Content`, then executed it. Ultimately replaced need with a permanent maintenance script.

## 6. Environment variable mismatch for batch size
**Symptom:** Confusion: `.env` retained `BATCH_SIZE=50` while code defaulted to 20.

**Cause:** Documentation / implementation divergence after requirement change.

**Resolution:** Code honors explicit CLI or internal default 20; environment variable to be aligned later. (Action item.)

## 7. Missing structured output fields risk / schema drift
**Symptom:** Concern about LLM dropping required keys.

**Cause:** Prompt or schema not strictly enforced without structured parsing.

**Resolution:** Using `responses.parse` with Pydantic schema ensures automatic validation; invalid outputs raise early exceptions.

## 8. Minimal logging for failed image attempts
**Symptom:** Hard to diagnose why two images failed.

**Cause:** Retry loop only printed generic messages; failures not persisted.

**Resolution (Planned):** Enhance `_generate_single_image` to log error details (status codes, messages) and record to a `failed_images.json` for post-run analysis.

---
**Planned Mitigations / Enhancements:**
- Add regeneration mode (`--repair-missing-images`) to attempt image creation for still-missing entries before pruning.
- Persist structured error diagnostics for image failures.
- Add lightweight tests to cover pruning and schema validation.
